# CPSC 224 Final Project: The Ultimate Connect Four

### Project Description:
A traditional game of Connect Four, but instead of two players, the game
will be able to handle up to 4 players, each with their own chosen icon/token
to represent the disk in the real life game.

Otherwise, the game rules will adhere to the traditional game of Connect Four,
where a player wins if they connect four of their tokens in 4 successive spots,
either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
